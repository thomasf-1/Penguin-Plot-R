# Penguin-Plot-R

This project is to show function writing and data visualization skills in R. The data set used is palmerpenguins, and it contains various measurements of penguins, from bodyweight to beak length. The data set can be installed through R using install.packages(). 

The function takes in one input (the penguin species), and outputs a scatterplot with flipper length on the x-axis and body weight on the y-axis, separated by gender. In the plot there is also a line of best fit, describing the relationship between the two variables.
